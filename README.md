<h1> Hybrid Time Series Forecasting Method:Knowledge-embedded deep kernel network </h1>

We provide a method to embed knowledge items ( controlling** relationship equations and instance solutions**) from expert experience and experimental results into KDN for time series prediction.
Experimental results show that this method greatly improves prediction performance in noisy environments. At the same time, it has higher modeling efficiency than traditional deep learning methods under unstable working conditions in the process industry. 
We very much look forward to your feedback and will update this technology in a timely manner
